Open food facts is a free and open database gathering informations and data about food products from all around the world. For each item, the database stores its generic name, category, list of ingredients, food additives and nutritional information, quantity and type of packaging. It also provides the manufacturing or processing locations, countries and stores where the product is sold. 

Each contributor can add or edit food items based on the information explicitly shown on the package. Mobile phone applications allow for capturing photos and information that are reprocessed manually by volunteers.

### Nutriscore: Replacing the nutrition facts panel

{% include figure.html image="assets/images/nutriscore.png"  width="300" height="500" %}

The Nutrition Facts panel first began appearing on food packaging in the early 1990s (implementation deadline 
was 1994). The label quickly became famous in its own right. Before that date, people bought products without knowing their constituents. 

Today, it is mandatory to put on all prepackaged foods, the table of nutritional values, which is often difficult to decrypt for consumers.To facilitate understanding and comparing the products, open food facts offers a complementary nutritional information: the nutri score. Each product is thus positioned on a scale of 5 levels: from A to E ranging from:
* the most nutritionally favorable product (class A)
* the least nutritionally beneficial product (class E)

This nutri score rating is calculated by taking into account:
* Energy, saturated fats, sugar, sodium (high levels are considered to be bad for your health)
* Proportion of fruits, vegetables and nuts, fiber and protein (high levels are considered good for health).

## Packaging : From wood crates to high art:

For centuries, food, beverages and other consumer goods were largely sold in nameless glass jugs, wood crates, steel cans and cloth bags. Packaging was largely an expensive proposition and thus reserved for luxury goods, such as jewelry or premium foods. It wasn’t until the late 19th Century that tin and paperboard products became cheap enough for manufacturers to utilize them on a wide scale.

Many factors  can make package design memorable: strong color, imagery, fonts, copy and the right substrate. Procter& Gamble certainly got it right with Tide detergent in 1946. It was designed by a famed architect and designer and is considered the first national product to use bright colors.

According to AdAge (weekly magazine that covers all aspects of the US advertising market.), “The dominant orange and yellow used for the Tide box were intended to alarm and convey a sense of heavy-duty power...The bold lettering of the word ‘Tide’ was in blue and intended to offset the possible dangers implied in the orange and yellow with a safer, reassuring emotional message.”

#### Packaging of food products:

The choice of colors of the packaging, as explained above, is very important to simulate the desired impact on the consumer. It is then very interesting to quantify the use of color in the food industry, and discover what colors are employed to gain customer's attention and increase their appetite.

From the figure 1 above, 3 colors are undoubtly dominant on the products packagings: red, orange and yellow. 
But how can we explain this trend ?
